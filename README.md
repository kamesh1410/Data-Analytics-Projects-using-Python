# Data Analytics Projects Using Python

## Data Inspection
Performed an initial exploration of the dataset to understand its structure and key characteristics.

## Data Preprocessing
- Checked for missing values.
- Handled null entries.
- Cleaned the data to ensure quality and consistency.

## Data Transformation
- Encoded categorical columns.
- Normalized numerical columns where necessary to prepare the data for analysis.

## Data Visualization
- Conducted detailed visualizations for each column to gain insights, considering the type of data (categorical or numerical).

## Categorical Analysis
- Generated bar plots and pie charts to observe the distribution of categories.

## Numerical Analysis
- Used histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to analyze distributions, trends, and outliers.

## Insights Extraction
- Derived meaningful insights from the data visualization process to guide further analysis.
